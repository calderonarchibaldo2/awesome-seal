## Infra and tools

- [Seal Rust SDK](https://github.com/gfusee/seal-sdk-rs) - A community-maintained Rust SDK for Seal, providing idiomatic bindings to encrypt, decrypt, and interact with Seal key servers and policies.
- [Sui Stack Messaging SDK](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-stack-messaging-sdk) - A complete, end-to-end encrypted messaging solution for Web3 applications. It uses Seal to encrypt messages and attachments, with programmable access policies for message channels.
- [Distributed Key Vault for Nautilus Enclaves](https://github.com/lockin-bot/seal-kms) - [Lockin Bot's](https://lockin.bot/) zero-trust key vault for [Nautilus](https://sui.io/nautilus) based apps. The master key lives inside a Nautilus enclave itself, and that is secured with Seal. When a Nautilus-based service needs access, the enclave proves it’s legit and derives a use-specific key. The master key never leaves or gets exposed.
- [SealBridge for Unity WebGL](https://github.com/viol3/Sui-Unity-SDK/tree/zk-login/Assets/Sui-Unity-SDK/Code/Sui.Seal) - A Unity bridge that integrates Seal encryption into game environments, enabling onchain policy-based access control and secure data exchange between Unity apps and the Sui blockchain.
- [Tusky Token-Gated Access](https://github.com/tusky-io/tusky-smart-contracts/blob/main/TGA.md) - [Tusky’s](https://tusky.io/) token-gated access (TGA) capability lets you restrict vault content exclusively to users holding specific tokens. Built with Seal, it enables secure, composable token-based access to encrypted files in private vaults.
- [Decryptable Move Enum](https://github.com/studio-mirai/decryptable) - A Sui Move package implements a `Decryptable` enum which stores a decryptable piece of data. Recommends Seal for encryption.
- [Dominion Lancer](https://lancer.dominion.zone/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/dominion-zone/dominion-lancer): A secure and confidential platform for responsible vulnerability disclosure on the Sui blockchain. Submit exploits via trusted enclaves, generate verifiable evidence, and enable safe, onchain researcher rewards.

## B2B and B2C projects

- [Article Garden](https://article.garden/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/jnaulty/article-garden): A decentralized, privacy-first publishing platform on Sui, like Substack meets encryption, where content is end-to-end encrypted, subscriptions are NFTs, and privacy is the default.
- [Epoch One](https://epoch-one.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/T-adero1/epoch_one): EpochOne E-Sign is a contract management platform that merges traditional e-signatures with blockchain security. Users can create, manage, and sign contracts with cryptographic protection and decentralized storage.
- [Zeroleaks](https://www.zeroleaks.xyz/) - [Docs](https://zeroleaks.notaku.site/): ZeroLeaks is a secure, anonymous, and verifiable whistleblowing platform built on the Sui blockchain. It uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect whistleblowers while proving the authenticity of leaked documents.
- [Sui Shadow](https://sui-shadow.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/Sahilgill24/SuiShadow): Sui Shadow is a privacy-first art platform on Sui where artists encrypt hidden artworks into NFTs using Seal-powered access control. Encrypted chunks are stored off-chain in Walrus, and collectors unlock them post-purchase for a secure, suspenseful reveal.
- [Passman](https://passman-six.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/dam2onkid/passman): Passman is a decentralized password manager built on Sui, secured with Seal encryption technology. It gives users full control over their passwords without relying on any central authority.
- [Mandy](https://mandylab.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/rzexin/Mandy): Mandy is a Sui-based dApp for sending encrypted `time capsule` letters unlockable at a future date. Seal handles encryption and timed decryption, while attachments are securely stored in Walrus.
- [SuiShare](https://sui-share.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/xiaodi007/suiShare): SuiShare is a decentralized content publishing platform on Sui for encrypted media like images, videos, and markdown. It gives creators full ownership, access control, and monetization tools in a censorship-resistant environment.
- [DemoDock](https://demo-dock.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/404ll/DemoDock/blob/main/README_EN.md): DemoDock is a decentralized platform for Web3 developers to securely store, manage, and showcase demo projects. It uses Seal for encryption, Walrus for storage, and gives creators and admins a private, organized space for collaboration and review.
- [Elur](https://github.com/calderonarchibaldo2/Elur) - [Docs](https://github.com/calderonarchibaldo2/Elur#readme): Elur is non-custodial, revocable file sharing on Sui. Encrypt any file on your device, share it through any channel, then revoke, expire, or limit access at any time — enforced on-chain by Seal's seal_approve gate. zkLogin and Enoki make it wallet-free and seedless, so non-crypto users just sign in with Google.
